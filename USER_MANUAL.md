## 2. Core Features

### The Drills Page

This is your main dashboard. It's split into two sections:

- **Review Queue:** At the top of the page, you'll find a list of drills that are due for review. This is powered by a Spaced Repetition System (SRS) that automatically schedules drills for you based on your performance, helping you build long-term muscle memory.
- **All Drills:** This is a list of all the practice drills available.

### Practicing a Drill

This is the core of the ML Dojo experience.

- **Real-Time Feedback:** You don't have to wait until the end to see how you're doing.
  - For Multiple Choice Questions (MCQs), you'll get instant feedback on whether your answer was correct or incorrect.
  - For code-based questions, a small checkmark or "x" will appear as you type, letting you know if your answer is correct.
- **The AI Assistant:** Your AI tutor is always available on the right-hand side.
  - **Proactive Hints:** If you get stuck on a code blank for more than a minute, the assistant will proactively offer to help.
  - **Deeper Explanations:** After you successfully complete a drill, a "Go Deeper" button will appear. Click this to get a more in-depth explanation of the concepts covered in the drill.
  - **Manual Help:** You can also ask for hints, clarifications, or code completions at any time.
- **Dynamic Difficulty:** At the top of each drill, you can select a "Workout Mode":
  - **Crawl:** The easiest mode, with many small blanks to guide you.
  - **Walk:** The default mode, with key concepts blanked out.
  - **Run:** The hardest mode, challenging you to write the solution from scratch.

### Creating a Custom Drill

You are not limited to the pre-defined drills.

1.  Click the "Create Custom Drill" button on the main drills page.
2.  Fill out the form, including the title, concept, difficulty, and a description.
3.  Add as many content blocks as you like:
    - **Theory:** A block of text to explain a concept.
    - **Code:** A block of code with blanks (represented by `____`).
