# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements the Code 7x5 font as the primary font throughout the OmniCode web application, replacing the current Inter font for general text while preserving Aurora Pro for the login page and JetBrains Mono for code blocks. The Code 7x5 font is a pixel-style monospace font that will enhance the retro coding aesthetic of the application.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want the web application to use the Code 7x5 font as the primary font, so that the interface has a consistent retro coding aesthetic.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application loads THEN the system SHALL use Code 7x5 font for all general text content
2. WHEN displaying text in components THEN the system SHALL apply Code 7x5 font to headings, paragraphs, buttons, and UI elements
3. WHEN rendering the interface THEN the system SHALL maintain proper font fallbacks for accessibility

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want the login page to retain its Aurora Pro font styling, so that the branding remains consistent with the current design.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing the login page THEN the system SHALL continue using Aurora Pro font for titles and branding
2. WHEN displaying login form elements THEN the system SHALL preserve existing font styling
3. WHEN navigating between login and main app THEN the system SHALL maintain distinct font identities

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want code blocks to continue using JetBrains Mono font, so that code remains highly readable and follows coding conventions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN displaying code blocks THEN the system SHALL use JetBrains Mono font
2. WHEN showing syntax highlighting THEN the system SHALL maintain monospace font characteristics
3. WHEN rendering interactive code elements THEN the system SHALL preserve code-specific typography

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want the font to load efficiently without causing layout shifts, so that the interface feels smooth and professional.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the page loads THEN the system SHALL preload the Code 7x5 font to prevent font swapping
2. WHEN fonts are loading THEN the system SHALL use appropriate fallback fonts
3. WHEN the font fails to load THEN the system SHALL gracefully degrade to system fonts

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user with accessibility needs, I want the font implementation to support proper contrast and readability, so that the application remains accessible.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN displaying text THEN the system SHALL maintain sufficient contrast ratios
2. WHEN users have reduced motion preferences THEN the system SHALL respect accessibility settings
3. WHEN the font renders THEN the system SHALL ensure proper letter spacing and line height for readability
