# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The ML Dojo application is currently experiencing critical performance and functionality issues that prevent users from effectively using the platform. The application loads extremely slowly, navigation between pages doesn't work properly, and the "Create Custom Drill" functionality is non-responsive. These issues need to be resolved to provide users with a smooth, responsive learning experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN the initial page load SHALL complete within 3 seconds
2. WHEN I navigate between pages THEN the page transition SHALL complete within 1 second
3. WHEN I interact with buttons or forms THEN the response SHALL be immediate (< 200ms)
4. WHEN the application loads THEN there SHALL be no console errors related to performance

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to navigate seamlessly between different sections of the application, so that I can access all features without issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

4. WHEN I navigate to a protected route THEN authentication SHALL be properly handled

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want to create custom drills using AI assistance, so that I can generate personalized learning content.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I enter a prompt in the AI generation field THEN the system SHALL generate a complete drill structure
2. WHEN the AI generation completes THEN the form SHALL be populated with the generated content
3. WHEN AI generation fails THEN I SHALL receive a clear error message
4. WHEN I submit a custom drill THEN it SHALL be saved to the database successfully

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want all UI components to render correctly and be fully functional, so that I can interact with the application without visual or functional issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I view any page THEN all UI components SHALL render without errors
2. WHEN I interact with forms THEN all form controls SHALL work properly
3. WHEN I view drill cards THEN all information SHALL display correctly
4. WHEN I use the application on different screen sizes THEN the responsive design SHALL work properly

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want the Firebase integration to work reliably, so that my data is properly saved and retrieved.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I authenticate THEN the Firebase connection SHALL work without API key errors
2. WHEN I create or view drills THEN the Firestore database operations SHALL complete successfully
3. WHEN I perform any database operation THEN appropriate loading states SHALL be shown
4. WHEN database operations fail THEN clear error messages SHALL be displayed
