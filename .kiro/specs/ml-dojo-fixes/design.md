# Design Document

## Overview

The OmniCode application requires comprehensive fixes to address performance bottlenecks, navigation issues, and AI integration problems. The design focuses on optimizing the application architecture, fixing broken components, and ensuring reliable Firebase and Genkit integration.

## Architecture

### Current Issues Analysis

1. **Performance Bottlenecks**:
   - Genkit AI integration causing slow responses
   - Inefficient Firebase queries loading too much data
   - Missing loading states causing perceived slowness
   - Potential memory leaks in React components

2. **Navigation Problems**:
   - Missing route handlers for some pages
   - Authentication state not properly managed
   - Client-side routing conflicts

3. **AI Integration Issues**:
   - Genkit flows may not be properly configured
   - Server actions might have incorrect imports
   - API routes potentially missing or misconfigured

## Data Models

### Drill Model Optimization
```typescript
interface OptimizedDrill {
  id: string;
  title: string;
  concept: string;
  difficulty: 'Beginner' | 'Intermediate' | 'Advanced';
  description: string;
  drill_content?: DrillContent[];
  // Add caching metadata
  lastModified: Date;
  contentHash: string;
}
```

### Performance Metrics Model
```typescript
interface PerformanceMetrics {
  pageLoadTime: number;
  navigationTime: number;
  aiResponseTime: number;
  databaseQueryTime: number;
}
```

## Error Handling

### Error Boundary Strategy
- Implement React Error Boundaries for each major section
- Graceful degradation when AI services are unavailable
- User-friendly error messages with actionable guidance

### Firebase Error Handling
- Specific error handling for different Firebase error codes
- Retry logic for transient network issues
- Fallback UI states when data is unavailable

### AI Service Error Handling
- Timeout handling for slow AI responses
- Fallback content when AI generation fails
- Clear user feedback during AI processing

## Testing Strategy

### Performance Testing
- Lighthouse audits for page load performance
- React DevTools Profiler for component performance
- Network throttling tests for slow connections

### Functionality Testing
- Navigation flow testing across all routes
- Form submission and validation testing
- AI generation workflow testing
- Firebase CRUD operation testing

### Integration Testing
- End-to-end user workflows
- Authentication flow testing
- Cross-browser compatibility testing

- Use Firebase query cursors for efficient data loading
- Add proper indexing for frequently queried fields

### AI Service Architecture
- Implement circuit breaker pattern for AI service calls
- Add request queuing to prevent overwhelming the AI service
- Use streaming responses where possible to improve perceived performance

### Caching Strategy
- Implement client-side caching for drill data
- Use React Query or SWR for server state management
- Add proper cache invalidation strategies
