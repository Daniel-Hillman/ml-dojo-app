# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements a comprehensive live code execution system that allows users to run code directly in the browser across multiple programming languages. The system will transform OmniCode from a static learning platform into an interactive coding environment, enabling real-time experimentation and immediate feedback for learners.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a learner, I want to execute code directly in the browser without leaving the platform, so that I can experiment with concepts immediately and see results instantly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I click a "Run Code" button THEN the system SHALL execute the code and display results within 3 seconds
2. WHEN code execution completes THEN the system SHALL show output, errors, or visual results in a dedicated output panel
3. WHEN I modify code THEN the system SHALL allow me to re-run it without page refresh
4. WHEN execution takes too long THEN the system SHALL provide a timeout mechanism with user feedback

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a web developer, I want to run HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code with live preview, so that I can see visual results and interact with my creations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I run HTML/CSS/JS code THEN the system SHALL render the output in a sandboxed iframe
2. WHEN the code includes interactive elements THEN the system SHALL allow user interaction within the preview
3. WHEN I update the code THEN the system SHALL provide live reload functionality
4. WHEN code contains errors THEN the system SHALL display console errors and warnings

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a Python developer, I want to execute Python code with ML libraries, so that I can practice data science and machine learning concepts interactively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I run Python code THEN the system SHALL execute it using Pyodide in the browser
2. WHEN I import common libraries THEN the system SHALL support numpy, pandas, matplotlib, and scikit-learn
3. WHEN code generates plots THEN the system SHALL display visualizations inline
4. WHEN I use print statements THEN the system SHALL capture and display all output

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a database learner, I want to execute SQL queries with sample data, so that I can practice database operations and see immediate results.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I run SQL code THEN the system SHALL execute queries using in-browser SQLite
2. WHEN queries return data THEN the system SHALL display results in a formatted table
3. WHEN I create tables THEN the system SHALL persist data within the session
4. WHEN SQL has syntax errors THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to work with multiple programming languages in a unified interface, so that I can learn and compare different approaches to solving problems.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I select a language THEN the system SHALL automatically configure the appropriate execution environment
2. WHEN switching languages THEN the system SHALL maintain separate execution contexts
3. WHEN code requires specific syntax highlighting THEN the system SHALL apply language-appropriate formatting
4. WHEN I share code THEN the system SHALL preserve language selection and execution state

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a security-conscious user, I want code execution to be safe and sandboxed, so that malicious code cannot harm my system or access sensitive data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any code executes THEN the system SHALL run it in a completely sandboxed environment
2. WHEN code attempts file system access THEN the system SHALL block unauthorized operations
3. WHEN code tries network requests THEN the system SHALL restrict access to approved domains only
4. WHEN execution consumes excessive resources THEN the system SHALL terminate and provide feedback

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a learner, I want to save and share my code experiments, so that I can build a portfolio of working examples and collaborate with others.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I create working code THEN the system SHALL allow me to save it to my personal collection
2. WHEN I save code THEN the system SHALL preserve both source and execution results
3. WHEN I share code THEN the system SHALL generate shareable links with embedded execution
4. WHEN viewing shared code THEN the system SHALL allow others to fork and modify examples

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a mobile user, I want code execution to work on my phone or tablet, so that I can learn and practice coding anywhere.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using mobile devices THEN the system SHALL provide touch-friendly code editing
2. WHEN screen space is limited THEN the system SHALL offer collapsible output panels
3. WHEN typing on mobile THEN the system SHALL provide code completion and syntax helpers
4. WHEN execution completes THEN the system SHALL optimize output display for small screens
