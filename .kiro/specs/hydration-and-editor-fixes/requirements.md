# Hydration and Editor Fixes - Requirements Document

## Introduction

This spec addresses critical hydration errors and TypeScript issues that are preventing the application from functioning properly. The errors include React hydration mismatches and a TypeError in the SyntaxHighlightedEditor component where `placeholder is not a function`.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Fix React Hydration Errors

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to load without hydration errors so that I can use the platform reliably.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application loads THEN there SHALL be no hydration mismatch errors in the console
2. WHEN components render on the server THEN they SHALL match exactly with client-side rendering
3. WHEN using dynamic content THEN it SHALL be properly handled to prevent hydration mismatches
4. WHEN browser extensions are present THEN the application SHALL still render correctly
5. WHEN date/time values are used THEN they SHALL be consistent between server and client

### Requirement 2: Fix SyntaxHighlightedEditor TypeError

**User Story:** As a user, I want the code editor to work properly so that I can write and execute code without errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the SyntaxHighlightedEditor component loads THEN there SHALL be no "placeholder is not a function" errors
2. WHEN creating extensions for CodeMirror THEN the placeholder function SHALL be properly imported and used
3. WHEN the editor renders THEN all CodeMirror extensions SHALL be properly initialized
4. WHEN switching between different code languages THEN the editor SHALL update without errors
5. WHEN the editor is used in different components THEN it SHALL work consistently

### Requirement 3: Ensure SSR Compatibility

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all components to be SSR-compatible so that the application works correctly in production.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN components use browser-specific APIs THEN they SHALL check for client-side environment first
2. WHEN components use dynamic imports THEN they SHALL be properly handled for SSR
3. WHEN components use external libraries THEN they SHALL be compatible with Next.js SSR
4. WHEN components render THEN they SHALL not cause layout shifts or hydration issues
5. WHEN the application is built for production THEN there SHALL be no SSR-related warnings

### Requirement 4: Fix Component State Management

**User Story:** As a user, I want components to maintain consistent state so that the UI behaves predictably.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN components initialize THEN their state SHALL be consistent between server and client
2. WHEN using localStorage or sessionStorage THEN it SHALL be accessed only on the client side
3. WHEN components use random values or timestamps THEN they SHALL be handled to prevent hydration mismatches
4. WHEN components re-render THEN they SHALL maintain their state correctly
5. WHEN navigating between pages THEN component state SHALL be properly reset or maintained

### Requirement 5: Improve Error Handling and Debugging

**User Story:** As a developer, I want better error handling so that I can quickly identify and fix issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN errors occur THEN they SHALL be properly caught and logged with useful information
2. WHEN hydration errors happen THEN the application SHALL provide clear debugging information
3. WHEN TypeScript errors occur THEN they SHALL be resolved with proper type definitions
4. WHEN components fail to render THEN there SHALL be appropriate fallback UI
5. WHEN in development mode THEN error messages SHALL be detailed and actionable
