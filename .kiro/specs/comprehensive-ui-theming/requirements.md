# Comprehensive UI Theming & Performance Optimization - Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification addresses critical issues preventing deployment:
1. **White Background Issues**: Code snippets and buttons in the learn page have white backgrounds that don't match the app theme
2. **Performance Optimization**: Loading times are too slow for production deployment

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Fix White Background Issues in Learn Page

**User Story:** As a user, I want all UI elements in the learn page to have consistent theming, so that the interface feels cohesive and professional.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN I visit the learn page THEN all code snippet previews SHALL have dark theme backgrounds instead of white
2. WHEN I view template cards THEN they SHALL use theme-appropriate backgrounds and hover states
3. WHEN I interact with "Use Template" buttons THEN they SHALL have consistent styling with the rest of the app
4. WHEN I view the compact template browser THEN all elements SHALL blend with the app theme

### Requirement 2: Optimize Application Performance

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to load quickly, so that I can start using it without delays.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN I load any page THEN the initial page load SHALL complete in under 3 seconds
2. WHEN I navigate between pages THEN transitions SHALL be smooth and responsive
3. WHEN I interact with code editors THEN they SHALL load without blocking the UI
4. WHEN I use dynamic imports THEN they SHALL not cause loading delays

### Requirement 3: Bundle Size Optimization

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the application bundle to be optimized for production, so that deployment is feasible.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN the app is built for production THEN the main bundle SHALL be under 1MB
2. WHEN code is split THEN chunks SHALL load efficiently without blocking
3. WHEN unused code exists THEN it SHALL be eliminated through tree shaking
4. WHEN heavy dependencies are used THEN they SHALL be lazy loaded appropriately
