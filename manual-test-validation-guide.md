# Manual Test Validation Guide - Practice Drills Enhancement

This guide provides comprehensive manual testing scenarios to validate the Practice Drills Enhancement feature beyond automated tests. These tests focus on user experience, visual validation, and edge cases that require human verification.

## 🎯 Testing Objectives

- Validate complete user journeys from community discovery to practice
- Ensure drill functionality works identically regardless of source
- Test various user scenarios (no drills, many drills, mixed content)
- Verify all requirements through hands-on testing
- Validate visual design and user experience

## 📋 Pre-Testing Setup

### Test User Accounts
