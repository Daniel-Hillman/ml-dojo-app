### ðŸš€ Next Steps: Towards a World-Class Tutor

My goal is to implement the expert suggestions we discussed. I will tackle them in order, starting with the most impactful and foundational feature.

*   **Phase 1: Implement Granular, Real-Time Feedback**
    *   [x] **MCQ Questions:**
        *   [x] Modify the drill page to provide instant validation and feedback when a user selects an MCQ answer.
        *   [x] Update the UI to visually distinguish between correct and incorrect answers.
        *   [x] Disable MCQ questions once answered correctly.
    *   [x] **Code Blocks:**
        *   [x] Add real-time validation for individual blanks in code drills.
        *   [x] Provide subtle UI cues (e.g., checkmarks) for correct answers.

*   **Phase 2: Develop a Spaced Repetition System (SRS)**
    *   [x] Track user performance on each drill (time, hints, attempts).
    *   [x] Create an algorithm to schedule future drill reviews based on performance.
    *   [x] Build a "Review Queue" on the main drills page.

*   **Phase 3: Enhance the AI Tutor**
    *   [x] Implement proactive hints when the user appears to be stuck.
    *   [x] Enable the AI to offer deeper explanations after a drill is completed.

*   **Phase 4: Introduce Dynamic Difficulty**
    *   [x] Create different "workout modes" (Crawl, Walk, Run) for drills.
    *   [x] Allow the app to adapt the difficulty based on user performance.
